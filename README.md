Bayesian probability learners
=============================

This repository has code for two Bayesian models that learn latent binomial probabilities in nonstationary environments. The first is a direct implementation of the model in [this paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17676057), while the second is a simpler model.

You can view the example notebooks for the the two learners statically:

- [Volatility learner](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/mwaskom/optlearner/master/VolatilityLearner.ipynb).
- [Probability learner](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/mwaskom/optlearner/master/ProbabilityLearner.ipynb).
